# Project Euler Archived Problems

This repository contains my efforts at finding solutions to the first 100 archived problems on https://projecteuler.net/

On first pass, I am solving the problems using "vanilla" JavaScript. While many problems could be solved without passing arguments into the methods, I am trying to pass arguments to make the methods more flexible.

After I hit certain milestones of completion, I pass back through and refactor my solutions.

After getting a good number of solutions in JavaScript, I intend to pass back through using Python.
